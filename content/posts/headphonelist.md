# Welp, We are doing this

New headphone ranking, here we go

## Rules:
- ranking is based on a spotify & cd test
- iems are allowed on the list
- quality is put into account
- repairability is put into account
- cable is also put into account
- ratings can be adjusted
- * means that i only listened to them not owned them

1. beyerdynamic DT880 pro 250ohm - 8.9/10 - brilliant sounding headphones, fantastic soundstage, really good neutral sound, good bass, brilliant clarity, solid quality, only one problem is the coiled non-detachable cable and certain faults
2. sennheiser HD560S* - 8/10 - great soundstage, great neutral sound, great quality, detachable cable, wears weird on my head though
3. audio-technica ATH-M50X*  - 7.5/10 - great quality, comfortable for my head, detachable audio cable, doesnt isolate sound too well
4. sony MDR-7506* - 6.9/10 (nice) - fantastic quality, great balanced sound, comfortable, coiled cable, not that wide of a soundstage
5. superlux HD681 - 6.8/10 - cheap af for how good they sound, balanced, uncomfortable and hurt after a few hours of use, you get what you pay for
6. salnotes zero* - 6.5/10 - really punchy, but they fit good weirdly enough
7. kz zst - 6/10 - cheap but solid quality, punchy sound, slightly scratchy but detachable cable
8. kz es4 - 5.75/10 - cheap, balanced BUT not too balanced, slightly scratchy cable but its detachable
9. hyperX cloud II - 5/10 - surprisingly good sound, good punch, mic is nice, but not best sound or soundstage
10. Soundcore q20i - 4.5/10 - good on the go sound, really nice quality, decent NC, comfortable
11. AKG k52 - 3.5/10 - very bassy, really weird frequency responce, quality isnt bad, weigh basically nothing, soundstage is meh, overall meh, but the price is very nice
12. sennheiser EPOS GSP500 - 3.5/10 - very bassy, bad mids, quality is solid BUT THE CABLE IS VERY SCRATCHY, its detachable tho
13. AKG samsung earbuds - 0/10 - no words, just the worst
